Port	Protocol	Common Service	Description	Security Notes
80	TCP	HTTP (Web Server)	Default port for unencrypted websites. Used by Apache, Nginx, IIS, etc.	Data is unencrypted. Susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. Should redirect to HTTPS.
443	TCP	HTTPS (Secure Web)	Encrypted web traffic using SSL/TLS. Standard for secure sites.	Proper certificate validation is critical. Commonly targeted for SSL vulnerabilities.
1900	TCP/UDP	UPNP (Universal Plug and Play)	Used for automatic discovery of devices on local networks (e.g., smart TVs, routers).	Often misconfigured. Can expose internal services to external attackers.
7443	TCP	OracleAS HTTPS	HTTPS variant used by Oracle Application Server and admin consoles.	Often used for management interfaces â€” a prime target for attacks if left exposed.
8080	TCP	HTTP-Proxy / Alternate HTTP	Alternate HTTP port used by proxies or for apps like Jenkins, Tomcat, etc.	Must ensure authentication if used as a proxy or dashboard. Can leak data if misconfigured.
8443	TCP	HTTPS-Alt / Admin Panels	Secure web interface for administration (used by Tomcat, VMware, etc.).	Should be protected by authentication and not exposed to the public unless necessary.

 Security Recommendations
Area	Recommendation
 HTTPS/SSL	Ensure TLS certificates are valid, not expired, and use modern ciphers.
 Access Controls	Management and admin ports (7443, 8443, 8080) should require login and IP-based restrictions.
 Firewall	Restrict UPNP (1900) to internal LAN only, and monitor for unusual traffic.
 Monitoring	Log traffic to these ports, especially 8080 and 7443, as they are common targets in exploits.
